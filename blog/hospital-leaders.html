As a card-carrying member of the Society for Hospital Medicine (SHM), I might be biased, but I’m continually impressed by the caliber of people who speak and attend SHM conferences.</p>

<p>Our MedAptus team had a wonderful experience at the recent SHM Leadership Academy in Orlando FL.  It seems that at most industry events, attendees wander through the exhibit hall, picking up free stuff along the way, and primarily  planning out the next session that they’re going to.  However, at the Leadership Academy, our team had meaningful interactions with dozens of attendees who were actively engaged.  The thing that struck me the most was how interested they were in finding out about new products that could help their hospitalist group, and how quickly they grasped the subtleties of the larger impact that even small changes can make.</p>
 
<p>Those of us from MedAptus participating in the conference were particularly excited to talk about Assign, our newest software product (and part of our care coordination suite) that automates the process of assigning patients to providers each morning.  Normally when I begin speaking about the benefits of Assign, such as improving continuity of care, facilitating geographic/multi-disciplinary rounds, improving charge reconciliation, driving physician labor savings, etc.,  the light goes on for people.  At SHM though after  describing what Assign does, we  barely had to start talking about the benefits, and our audience members were already two steps ahead.  These attendees could immediately see the value, and were already coming up with new ideas for making Assign even better.  This is what is so great about SHM events: rather than merely cursory interactions with people who just happened to catch your eye, we instead had genuine interactions with people who want to continue to drive the field of hospital medicine forward.</p>
 
<p>I was also lucky enough to spend some time picking Dr. John Nelson’s brain about what we’re doing with Assign and how we can continue to improve it to better meet the needs of hospitalist groups.  As a practicing hospitalist, one of his pet peeves is when a hospitalist is unable to tell a patient who will be caring for them the next day, post-handoff.   It felt really good to be able to tell him that we have a solution to deal with this problem, today.  </p>
 
<p>So, thanks to all of the great attendees we met, and thanks to SHM for assembling such a worthwhile event attracting so many dedicated professionals. As the saying goes, we’re all in this together.</p>
