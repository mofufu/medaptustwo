							Today, we have a guest post by Dennis Bush, Product Development Consultant at MedAptus.

<p>Every business owner or manager periodically asks, “How is the business performing?” They review standard financial statements for a high-level understanding of revenue, expenses, net income, and cash flow. But the next question is invariably, “How can we improve?” That might spur some strategic thinking but far more frequently the focus is, “How can we improve operational performance – now?” Managers need to get out on the revenue cycle management “factory floor” and ask that about all the processes in their production chain. In the mid-cycle processes of the overall revenue management cycle, the core objectives are to capture patient charges fast, completely, and at low cost. To get it right, managers can focus on a few, simple key metrics:</p>

<p>
	<i class="icon arrow_right"></i>Lag – time from point of service to completion of the charge capture – booked and billed.<br>
<i class="icon arrow_right"></i>Capture – the proportion of appropriate charge opportunities actually captured and charged.<br>
<i class="icon arrow_right"></i>Efficiency/productivity – the administrative cost and effort getting the charges correctly captured and completed.</p>

Move It: Capturing a charge quickly is the first step in getting paid promptly for it. In this mid-cycle revenue management process, we define Lag as the total elapsed clock time from the provider-patient encounter (the service date-time), to the date-time when any charges for that encounter have been captured, completed, and entered into the automated billing/claims system for downstream processing and collection. The longer this lag, the higher the accounts receivable, the lower your cash balance on hand.</p>

<p>Tip: Most of lag time is idle time, waiting for someone to do something or for something to happen.</p>

<p>Of course, differences between paper-based and electronic charge capture systems are remarkable, given all the extra steps and added delay of non-electronic processes. Either way, the overall lag consists of three components, each of which involves separate processes, yet all can be improved.</p>

<p>Provider lag:</p>

<p>The ball is in the provider’s court until the charge is initiated, based on some indication, documentation, or action by the provider. Best practices are for providers to initiate charges, capturing critical service and diagnostic information electronically, as close to the point of care as possible. This obviously minimizes delay (lag) but has added benefits of more completely and accurately capturing all relevant charges and resolving any documentation and compliance conflicts while the facts are freshly before the provider.</p>

<p>If charges for the encounter have to be referred back to the provider by coders or other administrative staff for further details, resolution, or documentation, that puts the process – and clock time – back into the provider’s court.</p>

<p>Coder lag:</p>

<p>“Coders” or other administrative staff often review the charges from the provider-patient encounter to ensure that information has been correctly and completely captured, check for required documentation, and resolve potential conflicts with billing, payer and clinical compliance rules. “Getting it right” the first time may add to lag at this mid-cycle stage but pays/ off substantially in reducing downstream lag and additional work in claims adjudication, payer inquiries, reimbursement denials and appeals.</p>

<p>Getting it right often means a lot of back-and-forth with the provider, adding to both coder and provider lag, as well as increased effort and provider frustration. A best practice is to avoid coder lag and effort by having the provider resolve many of these issues with interactive alerts at the point of charge capture by the provider. This involves a careful trade-off of workload between provider and coder, provider training and education, and quick and simple tools for providers to resolve these issues in the course of their workflow with minimal hassle.</p>

<p>System lag:</p>

<p>Once the charges have been captured, completed and cleared for billing, the final step is entry into downstream automated billing/claims systems. In electronic charge capture systems, this is a straightforward process that can be handled by a simple interface to “post” the transactions from charge capture to the automated billing/claim system.</p>

<p>To reduce this component of lag, while the charges are sitting in the “outbox,” best practices include a real-time export interface. A near-time batch process, executing multiple times during the day, can be as effective. Of course, these lag reductions accelerate cash collection when the downstream billing/claims systems are also automated to turn around the transaction on the same day as inbound receipt.</p>

<p>As you can see, lag involves a lot of sub-processes, all of which can be measured and improved to accelerate cash collection.</p>
