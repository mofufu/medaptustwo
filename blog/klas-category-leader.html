As some of you may have read, earlier today we announced our fifth Best in KLAS Category Leader award. We were excited to once again be recognized as the leader in the Mobile Data Systems category which is dominated by charge capture vendors. In terms of what differentiates us from other groups with charge capture capabilities, we know that integration expertise continues to be a huge component that sets us apart. So what is our integration special sauce? For more on that, let’s hear from our director of integration engineering, Sean Harvey.</p>

<p>How did you get started in healthcare IT?</p>

<p>“In college, I majored in Business with focus on Management Information Systems. My first job was at IDX, now part of GE Healthcare and I started in electronic claims submission programming and technical support. Eventually I landed as interface analyst, designing integration strategies as opposed to programming.”</p>

<p>How long have you been working at MedAptus?</p>

<p>“Since the summer of 2000.”</p>

<p>How long have you been focusing on customer integration?</p>

<p>“Pretty much from the start- I would say since early 2001. I was part of MedAptus’ first deployment team when the charge capture product was new and the integration strategy wasn’t mature. I sort of tasked myself with taking it over and worked with the chief software architect to develop the core strategies for that are still used during MedAptus implementation today.”</p>

<p>What excites you about a new integration project?</p>

<p>“I get excited to work with customers in order to design the integration from the ground-up. MedAptus is unique from other revenue capture solutions because we don’t require our clients to use a boiler plate or template. At MedAptus we have integration standards, but usually customize because of our middle position among data systems.</p>

<p>Often, MedAptus is inserted in-between other systems so we need to be flexible with new projects. Each customer uses our application in slightly different ways, so even if they interface with a system that we are familiar with or is similar to other client practices, often their reconciling and interface views are different. Each customer has its own unique integration. I enjoy getting to work with the customers, their teams, and understanding their needs before designing the integration strategy.”</p>

<p>Sounds like you probably enjoy puzzles?</p>

<p>“I love puzzles. And even though I manage the team now, I still like to directly manage integration strategy.”</p>

<p>What is the biggest integration challenge that most clients face?</p>

<p>“Most of our clients have multiple types of end-users – providers, coders, administrators. These users all have different types of roles and thus vary in the ways  that they want to see data.  It’s important to get all groups together early on so that the implementation will actually meet their needs.”</p>

<p>How has integration changed since you started at MedAptus?</p>

<p>“MedAptus integrations have changed along with the application. From the start, HTTPS was at the core of our interfaces and integration matured rapidly as we worked with our early customers, such as Lahey Clinic. We also needed to be really flexible because MedAptus usually wasn’t an originating system for data, nor was it the final destination. We had to be ready for a lot of different types and formats of integration. We now have multiple integration standards that allow us more and different views of the data. We adjust each integration plan to make sure we get the correct data in.  In addition, MedAptus has begun taking in multiple types of inbound interfaces, can add interfaces to an existing environment, and can integrate much more efficiently than we could early on.</p>

<p>Finally, MedAptus has been able enhance our EHR integration capabilities and can provide several ways for our customers to share information from their EHR to MedAptus. Many customers do this via direct link within their clinical system while others integrate on the back-end, behind the scenes.”</p>

<p>What do you think sets MedAptus’ integration process apart from other revenue capture solutions? </p>

<p>“Flexibility and scalability. In working with other vendors, I have found that that other interface teams generally have a standard format and that’s it. With MedAptus, we can take a tough interface environment and are able to manipulate and customize to meet very specific customer needs.”</p>

<p>And there you have it. Flexibility, scalability, workflow support – these are the components we bring to every client integration to ensure data is accessible when and where it is needed.</p>
