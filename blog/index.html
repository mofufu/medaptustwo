								<h1><a href="hospital-leaders">Mingling with the Hospital Leaders of Tomorrow</h1><br><p>November 11, 2016 | Ryan Secan, MD, MPH</a></p>
								<p class="lead">
								As a card-carrying member of the Society for Hospital Medicine (SHM), I might be biased, but I’m continually impressed by the caliber of people who speak and attend SHM conferences.  Our MedAptus team had a wonderful experience at the recent SHM Leadership Academy in Orlando FL.  It seems that at most industry events, attendees wander through the exhibit hall, picking up free stuff along the way, and primarily  planning out the next session that they’re going to.</p>

								<h1><a href="hurt-nurse">It Shouldn’t Hurt to be a Nurse</h1><br><p>October 20, 2016 | Dan Nottingham</a></p>
								<p class="lead">
								Earlier this month, MedAptus unveiled our vision for our Assign for Nursing solution at the 2016 <a href="http://www.nursecredentialing.org/">American Nurses Credentialing Center</a> (ANCC) National Magnet Conference held in Orlando.  Also unveiled at event was a new campaign aimed at helping minimize work related injuries for nurses, “Save Our Nurses.” This movement recognizes the sacrifices nurses make every day to care for their patients and also recommends the implementation of changes to protect those who provide care.</p>

								<h1><a href="nursing-assign">Making Efficient, Equitable Assignments in Nursing</h1><br><p>October 1, 2016 | Jen Crowley</a></p>
								<p class="lead">
								As MedAptus continues in its quest to intelligently automate the clinical resource assignment process, our interest in the nursing arena has greatly intensified. While a lot of technology exists to aid in the areas of nurse scheduling and shift swapping, there has been little to no focus by technology companies to enhance and expedite the nurse-to-patient assignment process that typically happens three times a day. Spending a lot of time in hospitals myself, I have come to understand that most charge nurses are quite adept in mentally making assignments since they have excellent recall around patient histories, nursing personnel skills and certifications, and also have their finger on the pulse of all-around floor activity.</p>

								<h1><a href="physician-mobility">Physicians and Mobility</h1><br><p>September 5, 2016 | Ryan Secan, MD</a></p>
								<p class="lead">
								The release of Apple’s iOS 10 platform yesterday prompted me to reflect back on the last decade of mobile health. It nearly goes without saying, but to set the stage, physicians, technology, and their intersection have clearly come a long way in the last ten years.  Over a 5-year period from 2005-2009, I taught a course with some colleagues at the annual ACP meeting to help physicians learn how to use their mobile devices.</p>

								<p class="lead">
								Ah, Labor Day… a short work week for many, time to put away the white shoes and for most kids, back to school. As a mom of three kids, I know that one of the most important events leading up to the first day of school is the day when the teacher letters arrive in the mail. This is the envelope every kid feverishly rips open to see who new teacher will be, and then starts the frantic emailing/texting/facebooking to see which friends may or may not be in the same class.</p>

								<h1><a href="webinar-transform">Webinar: Transform your inpatient assignment</h1><br><p>July 15, 2016 | Jen Crowley</a></p>
								<p class="lead">
								If your hospital is like most, you’re doing patient distribution by hand. So someone who should be providing patient care is spending valuable time handling assignment instead. Maybe it’s always been done that way because it seems only an actual person could handle the nuances that go into patient assignment… but that’s not the case…</p>

							Aren’t healthcare acronyms fun? ACA, MU, PQRS, HIPAA, ACO… and most recently, MACRA. Learn it, live it, love it: Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act. Oh wow, an acronym in an acronym! And if you think that is confusing, wait until you to try to decipher and understand how payment reform can simultaneously promote fee-for-service…</p>

								<p class="lead">
								There are many frustrating aspects of dealing with a hospitalization, whether you, your child or your parent is the patient. One of the most challenging aspects is the entire lack of control, from having no say on the room location or nurse, to never knowing when there is going to be a knock on the…</p>

								When it comes to testimonials, I can be a skeptic. Just the other day I saw a commercial for something (I can’t remember what) where there are two people featured, no names, saying generic things like “XXX is great, I really like it.” As you can tell, the only lasting impression this had on me…</p>
