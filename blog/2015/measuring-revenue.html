Today, we have a guest post by Dennis Bush, Product Development Consultant at MedAptus.</p>

<p>Charge Capture Rate</p>

<p>As covered on Tuesday, reducing sources of lag and improving cash flow is important, but capturing charges completely where there are appropriate charge opportunities has the biggest impact on top-line revenue performance. There are lots of metrics that can be used to measure how well mid-cycle revenue management processes capture charges. First and foremost, let’s focus on the simplest and most critical metric: Was there a charge for the provider-patient encounter? Maybe charges were only partially captured or at an inappropriate level. Maybe no charge could be made – global fee, same-day/multiple E&M. But in the real-world, often noisy, process of charge capture, the most fundamental of missing charge incidents is failing to charge for a patient encounter where there should have been some charge. This is especially so in hospital settings, where there are myriad opportunities that go entirely missed by providers. Attending group and physician assignment, consults and referrals to other physicians, group and team rounding lists – these all provide information that can be used to identify expected charge opportunities, but these often don’t tell the whole story. The key metric to track here is charge capture rate, the percentage of expected charge opportunities where a provider has charged for a patient encounter.</p>

<p>For outpatient appointments, the percentage of appointments for which there is a charge by a provider for the patient is a straightforward measure. In hospital settings, the metric can be a bit more complicated – defining an expected charge and deciding what charged events “satisfy” that expectation. We can save the details for a later discussion, but the key metric is the same. The complement of the charge capture rate is a “missing charge rate”, which may be more motivating or threatening, depending on your organizational philosophy and temperament. We should also allow for expected charge opportunities to be flagged by providers as “no charge expected”, perhaps indicating the reason. These should be removed from the charge capture rate metrics. But it’s a good idea to track the degree to which potential opportunities are being flagged out, perhaps too leniently by providers.</p>

<p>Efficiency/Productivity</p>

<p>While charge capture drives top-line revenue, administrative costs hit the bottom line. Lots of effort, i.e. expense, goes into getting the charges right once the charge capture process has started. Best practices appropriately balance those efforts – between provider and coder/admin staff, and in the quality control to review and validate charges before they are billed. From an overall business standpoint, the administrative costs of these “back-office” staff are evident in operating income financials, in total and as a percentage of net revenue collected.</p>

<p>From a business standpoint, coder throughput – the number of patient-provider charge encounters per FTE coder – is a good measure out there on your factory floor. It’s one way to measure productivity, output over labor input. Again, a best practice is to have a significant volume of charge encounters go straight from a provider to charge export without coder intervention. So this throughput metric is defined as charge encounters per FTE coder, whether the coders touched the encounters or not. But this measure is a function of two processes – whether and when to refer the charges, once initiated, for review and completion, and what effort goes into the review and clean-up if needed. The gross measure doesn’t tell us enough about this latter process, how productive coders are when the charge is routed or referred to them. We want a key metric of coder productivity: how much activity is required of the coder to review and edit/complete the charges. Physician groups aren’t likely to have a stopwatch measuring the time that their coders spend reviewing each charge encounter. As a process measure, a group can however measure how often a coder “touches” an encounter, changing or editing it. The more this happens, the less productive they are. We’re not talking about how hard the coder works but how much time they are required to spend, and more labor time spent is lower productivity. While training and incentives may help staff work “smarter and faster”, we want to focus on the overall process. This will provide insights into what drives those demands for added work and will suggest how to re-engineer processes to improve real productivity, with reduced labor costs. Let’s save those details for a later discussion when we dig further into this part of the mid-cycle revenue capture process.</p>
