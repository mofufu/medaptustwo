style="text-decoration: underline;">9.1. Indemnification.</span> Except as provided below, MedAptus shall defend and indemnify the Customer from and against any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of any claim that the Software, as delivered, infringes a valid United States patent or copyright or misappropriates a trade secret of a third party, provided that (i) Customer shall have promptly provided MedAptus written notice thereof and reasonable cooperation, information, and assistance in connection therewith, and (ii) MedAptus shall have sole control and authority with respect to the defense, settlement, or compromise thereof. If the Software becomes or, in MedAptus’ opinion, is likely to become the subject of any injunction preventing its use as contemplated in the Documentation, MedAptus may, at its option, (1) procure such rights as may be necessary to permit continued use of the Software, (2) replace or modify the Software so that it becomes non-infringing without substantially compromising its functionality, or, if (1) and (2) are not reasonably available to MedAptus, then (3) terminate this Agreement, in which case Customer shall not be responsible for fees incurred subsequent to date of termination. MedAptus shall have no liability or obligation to the Customer hereunder with respect to any claim based upon (a) use of a superseded or altered release of the Software if the infringement would have been avoided by the use of a current unaltered release of the Software that MedAptus makes available to Customer; (b) the combination, operation or use of any Software furnished under this Agreement with software, hardware or other materials not furnished by MedAptus if such infringement would have been avoided by the use of the Software without such software, hardware or other materials; (c) use of the Software in an application or environment or on a platform or with devices for which the Software was not designed or contemplated; or (d) any patent, copyright or trade secret in which the Customer has an interest. Customer will immediately inform MedAptus as soon as Customer becomes aware of any threatened or actual liability claim by a third party relating to the Software. Infringement indemnification with respect to the Non-MedAptus Software is governed by the license agreements that are shipped with, or appear upon installation of, the System. The foregoing states the entire liability of MedAptus with respect to infringement and constitutes the exclusive remedy of Customer.</span><br
/> <span
style="font-size: 10pt;"><span
style="text-decoration: underline;">9.2. Procedure.</span> To obtain the benefit of the indemnifications set forth in Sections 9.1, the Customer must (a) promptly provide notification of the claim and reasonable cooperation to MedAptus; (b) tender to MedAptus complete control of the defense, settlement and compromise of the claim; and (c) not make any admissions to any third party regarding the claim or settle any indemnified claim except as approved by MedAptus in writing.

style="text-align: center;"><strong><span
style="font-size: 10pt;">BUSINESS ASSOCIATE AGREEMENT</span></strong></p><p><span
style="font-size: 10pt;">This Business Associate Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into by and between the customer as named on the applicable Service Order, (“Covered Entity”) and MedAptus, Inc. (the “Business Associate”) (each a “Party” and collectively the “Parties”), and is made a part of that certain service agreement or service agreements between the parties (the “Service Agreement”) pursuant to which Business Associate provides a service or services to Covered Entity that involves the creation, receipt, maintenance, or transmission of Covered Entity Protected Health Information (“PHI”).</span></p><p><span
style="font-size: 10pt;">NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:</span></p><p><strong><span
style="font-size: 10pt;">I. DEFINITIONS:</span></strong></p><p><span
style="font-size: 10pt;">A. Terms used but not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the same meaning as the meaning ascribed to those terms in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1320d (“HIPAA”), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, as codified at 42 U.S.C. § 17901 et seq. (“HITECH Act”), and any current and future regulations promulgated under HIPAA or the HITECH Act (HIPAA, HITECH Act and any current and future regulations promulgated under either are referred to as the “Regulations”).</span></p><p><span
style="font-size: 10pt;">B. Protected Health Information or PHI. “Protected Health Information” or “PHI” shall have the same meaning as the term “Protected Health Information” in 45 CFR § 160.103, limited to the information created, received, maintained or transmitted by Business Associate from or on behalf of Covered Entity, including but not limited to electronic PHI.</span></p><p><strong><span
style="font-size: 10pt;">II. PERMITTED USES AND DISCLOSURES BY BUSINESS ASSOCIATE:</span></strong></p><p><span
style="font-size: 10pt;">A. Business Associate may only use and disclose PHI as permitted by this Agreement or as required by law. Specifically, Business Associate may 1) use and disclose PHI to perform its obligations as set forth in the Service Agreement, provided that such use or disclosure would not violate HIPAA if done by Covered Entity; (2) use PHI for the proper management and administration of Business Associate or to carry out its legal responsibilities; (3) disclose PHI for the proper management and administration of Business Associate or to carry out its legal responsibilities, if such disclosure is required by law or if Business Associate obtains reasonable assurances from the recipient that the recipient will keep the PHI confidential, use or further disclose the PHI only as required by law or for the purpose for which it was disclosed to the recipient, and notify Business Associate of any instances of which it is aware in which the confidentiality of the PHI has been breached; (4) use PHI to provide data aggregation services relating to the health care operations of Covered Entity at the request and direction of Covered Entity; and (5) use PHI to create de-identified information for use by Covered Entity consistent with the standards set forth at 45 CFR §164.514 and at the request and direction of Covered Entity. Business Associate will not sell PHI or use or disclose PHI for purposes of marketing, as defined and proscribed in the Regulations.</span></p><p><span
style="font-size: 10pt;">B. Business Associate will limit its uses and disclosures of, and requests for, PHI (1) when practical, to the information making up a Limited Data Set; and (2) in all other cases subject to the requirements of 45 CFR § 164.502(b), to the minimum amount of PHI necessary to accomplish the intended purpose of the use, disclosure or request.</span></p><p><strong><span
style="font-size: 10pt;">III. OBLIGATIONS AND ACTIVITIES OF BUSINESS ASSOCIATE:</span></strong></p><p><span
style="font-size: 10pt;">A. Business Associate agrees not to use or disclose PHI other than as permitted or required by the Service Agreement, this Agreement, or as required by law. Business Associate will comply with the provisions of this Agreement related to privacy and security of PHI and the Regulations, as they may be modified from time to time, and that are applicable to Covered Entity or Business Associate. To the extent that Business Associate performs any of Covered Entity’s obligations under the Privacy Rule, Business Associate will comply with the requirements of the Privacy Rule that apply to Covered Entity in the performance of such obligation.</span></p><p><span
style="font-size: 10pt;">B. Business Associate agrees to use appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards, and comply with the Security Rule with respect to electronic PHI, to prevent the use or disclosure of the PHI other than as provided for by this Agreement.</span></p><p><span
style="font-size: 10pt;">C. Business Associate acknowledges and agrees that under the HITECH Act (i) the requirements of Sections 164.308 (administrative safeguards), 164.310 (physical safeguards), 164.312 (technical safeguards) and 164.316 (policies and procedures and documentation requirements) of the Security Rule apply to Business Associate in the same manner that such sections apply to Covered Entity, and (ii) the additional requirements of the HITECH Act that relate to security and that are made applicable to Covered Entity shall also be applicable to Business Associate (with such security requirements in (i) and (ii) above collectively referred to as the “HITECH Act Security Requirements”). Business Associate shall comply with the HITECH Act Security Requirements which shall be, by this reference, incorporated into this BA Agreement.</span></p><p><span
style="font-size: 10pt;">D. Unless Covered Entity agrees, in writing, that this requirement is infeasible with respect to particular data, Business Associate shall secure all Protected Health Information by a technology standard that renders Protected Health Information unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized individuals consistent with guidance issued by the Secretary, including the use of standards developed under Section 3002(b)(2)(B)(vi) of the Public Health Service Act, as added by the HITECH Act.</span></p><p><span
style="font-size: 10pt;">E. Business Associate shall ensure that any agents and subcontractors that create, receive, maintain or transmit PHI on behalf of Business Associate agree to comply with the same restrictions, conditions, and requirements that apply through this Agreement or otherwise to Business Associate with respect to such information. Business Associate shall enter into written agreements with any subcontractors, and the terms of such agreements shall incorporate the applicable requirements of, and otherwise comply with, the Regulations.</span></p><p><span
style="font-size: 10pt;">F. Business Associate will make available during normal business hours at Business Associate’s offices all records, books, agreements, internal practices, policies and procedures relating to the use or disclosure of PHI to the Secretary, in a time and manner designated by the Secretary, for purposes of determining compliance with the Regulations, subject to attorney-client and other applicable legal privileges.</span></p><p><span
style="font-size: 10pt;">G. Business Associate will provide documentation regarding any disclosures by Business Associate that would be required for an accounting of disclosures to an Individual under 45 CFR § 164.528 and the HITECH Act, within a reasonable amount of time of receipt of a request from Covered Entity. Any request under § 164.528 from an Individual made directly to Business Associate will be referred within five (5) business days to Covered Entity.</span></p><p><span
style="font-size: 10pt;">H. To the extent Business Associate maintains PHI in a Designated Record Set, Business Associate agrees to make PHI available for amendment and incorporate any amendments to PHI in accordance with the requirements of 45 C.F.R. § 164.526. Any request under § 164.526 from an Individual made directly to Business Associate will be referred within five (5) business days to Covered Entity.</span></p><p><span
style="font-size: 10pt;">I. To the extent Business Associate maintains PHI in a Designated Record Set, Business Associate agrees to make PHI available to the extent and in the manner required by 45 C.F.R. § 164.524. Any request under § 164.524 from an Individual made directly to Business Associate will be referred within five (5) business days to Covered Entity.</span></p><p><span
style="font-size: 10pt;">J. Business Associate agrees to comply with any requests for restrictions on certain disclosures of PHI to which Covered Entity has agreed in accordance with 45 C.F.R. § 164.522 and the Regulations and of which Business Associate has been notified by Covered Entity.</span></p><p><span
style="font-size: 10pt;">K. Subject to Section IV.C of this Agreement, Business Associate will return to Covered Entity or destroy, within thirty (30) days of the termination of this Agreement, any and all PHI in its possession and retain no copies (which for purposes of this Agreement shall include without limitation destroying all backup tapes and permanently deleting all electronic PHI).</span></p><p><span
style="font-size: 10pt;">L. Business Associate will mitigate, to the extent practicable, any harmful effects from any use or disclosure of PHI by Business Associate not permitted by this Agreement.</span></p><p><span
style="font-size: 10pt;">M. Business Associate agrees to notify within five (5) business days the designated Privacy Official of the Covered Entity of any use or disclosure of PHI by Business Associate not permitted by this Agreement, any Security Incident, and any Breach of Unsecured Protected Health Information of which Business Associate becomes aware.</span></p><p><span
style="font-size: 10pt;">1. Business Associate shall provide the following information to Covered Entity within ten (10) business days of discovery of a breach of unsecured PHI except when despite all reasonable efforts by Business Associate to obtain the information required, circumstances beyond the control of the Business Associate necessitate additional time. Under such circumstances Business Associate shall provide to Covered Entity the following information as soon as possible and without unreasonable delay, but in no event later than thirty (30) calendar days from the date of discovery of a breach:</span><br
/> <span
style="font-size: 10pt;">a. the date of the breach;</span><br

style="font-size: 10pt;">2.

style="font-size: 10pt;">3. Business Associate agrees to pay actual reasonable costs of notification and of any associated mitigation incurred by Covered Entity, such as credit monitoring, if Covered Entity determines that the breach is significant enough to warrant such measures.</span></p><p><span
style="font-size: 10pt;">4. Business Associate agrees to establish procedures to investigate the breach, mitigate losses, and protect against any future breaches, and to provide a description of these procedures and the specific findings of the investigation to Covered Entity in the time and manner reasonably requested by Covered Entity.</span></p><p><strong><span

Upon mutual agreement by the Parties that return or destruction of the PHI is infeasible, Business Associate shall extend the protections of this Agreement to such PHI and limit further uses and disclosures of such PHI to those purposes that make the return or destruction infeasible, for so long as Business Associate maintains the PHI.</span></p><p><strong><span
