Ranked the nation’s top cancer hospital for over 25 years by U.S. News & World Report’s “America’s Best Hospitals” survey, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center is one of the world’s most respected centers devoted exclusively to eliminating cancer in Texas, the nation, and the world through outstanding programs that integrate patient care, research and prevention, and through education for undergraduate and graduate students, trainees, professionals, employees and the public.</p>	
<p>In early 2004, while seeking to improve its revenue cycle management, the organization identified charge capture automation as a promising technology capable of enhancing revenue, as well as driving workflow and compliance improvements. MD Anderson was interested in this solution because it could serve as an effective replacement for the institution’s highly-manual paper-based charge capture workflow. This process consisted of clinicians documenting procedures on paper, in both the outpatient and inpatient settings; the collected information was then translated and codified by professional coding staff.</p>
<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-9">
<p>After a multi-disciplinary team representing physicians, administration, information technology, compliance and medical records was assembled, a six-month review system process commenced ultimately selected MedAptus as the vendor of choice. The goal of the project team at MD Anderson was to have an initial group of about 50 clinicians using MedAptus Pro Charge Capture in both outpatient and inpatient settings by early 2005. Assuming successful adoption within this pilot group, along with the realization of positive revenue and productivity results, the technology would then be rolled-out to another 400 clinicians over a two-year period.</p>

<p>The study revealed that, after taking into consideration patient volume changes and rate increases, for physician-users of MedAptus, gross charges increased by more than $1 million, when compared to the group’s 2005 baseline. When annualized, this experienced gross charge improvement equates to over $2 million, or approximately $50,000 per provider, on average.</p>	
<p>In addition the study found that charge lag decreased by approximately 75 percent while administrative productivity increased dramatically.</p>	
<p>Given the overall positive findings of the internal study, MD Anderson continued its system roll-out to nearly 1200 clinician end-users who enjoyed access to MedAptus on both devices and via EMR interoperability via workstations. In mid-2008, the organization expanded its relationship with MedAptus by implementing Infusion Charge Capture to 100 nurses who deliver 200 infusions daily as well as Tech Charge Capture to approximately 25 departments that deliver outpatient services.</p>

<p>In early 2016, MD Anderson completed its installation of Epic. Even with Epic in place across the massive campus, the facility has retained MedAptus for Infusion Services Charge Capture, in an interoperable manner within the Epic system. This installation allows nurses to complete clinical documentation in Epic and then access the MedAptus Infusion Worksheet with preserved patient context. </p>	
</div>

</div><br>
<p>Using MedAptus’ sophisticated technology for the complicated process that is outpatient infusion coding means that front line nurses can spend less time on administrative overhead and more time with patients given that the Infusion software automatically computes the appropriate charge data master codes for services delivered.  The software additionally runs a number of compliance rules to ensure that encounters are maximally reimbursed and not at risk of revenue loss from common infusion coding errors such as incorrect primary service documentation or problematic hydration therapy coding.</p>
