								    Boston – April 24, 2013 – MedAptus® today announced that UMass Memorial Health Care is rolling-out the company’s Technical Charge Capture (Tech) software. Tech, currently live in the departments of rheumatology and oncology at UMass Memorial Medical Center, helps to standardize the outpatient facility billing process by automating charge creation and operational management across the ambulatory care team.</p>

<p>UMass Memorial Health Care is the largest health care system in central and western Massachusetts, and the clinical partner of the University of Massachusetts Medical School. The five-hospital system employs 12,530 individuals and has approximately 1,700 affiliated physicians.</p>

<p>With 1.4 million annual outpatient visits, UMass Memorial Health Care required a technical coding and billing process that was simple for clinicians to manage, effective for compliance and also promoted payment timeliness. This is why the organization sought a proven technology solution.  Given that the MedAptus Tech product was created expressly for large outpatient hospitals eager to eliminate manual entry and reconciliation processes whilst leveraging existing system investments, the fit with UMass Memorial’s needs was a good one.</p>

<p>“With more services shifting from the inpatient arena to the ambulatory environment, it is imperative for organizations such as ours to be efficient and effective in our billing operations. Clinical and administrative staff alike have adopted MedAptus because it simplifies technical coding of both procedure and E&M levels, and in a fashion that applies professional charge components for full compliance and streamlined workflows,” said George Brenckle, Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer, UMass Memorial Health Care. “The deployment of MedAptus at our pilot departments has been successful and we are now gearing up for an enterprise roll-out to 100 other areas.”</p>

<p>MedAptus Tech is populated by two inbound data feeds at UMass Memorial – the first interface brings over appointment data and the second feed brings in professional charges as generated by the organization’s Allscripts EMR. Once the latter data enters MedAptus Tech, the patented software translates the interfaced professional charge data into a facility component, greatly simplifying the process of split-billing for UMass Memorial. For procedural-only visits such as vaccinations, those are entered directly into MedAptus Tech since those visits have no corresponding professional component.</p>

<p>“The implementation of our Tech solution at UMass Memorial has been an exciting project for MedAptus. We have enjoyed the opportunity to help a very large institution, in our backyard no less, improve upon manual processes that otherwise would require significant, and increasing, administrative resources. With ICD-10 quickly approaching, the timing could not be better for UMass Memorial to fully deploy our software and eliminate paper from the outpatient coding workflow. As more and more outpatient centers convert to “provider-based” status we expect the Tech integration model deployed at UMass Memorial will intrigue other large groups looking to make improvements to how they execute split-billing,” said Jeffrey Pagnini, MedAptus Vice President of Account Management.</p>
