								    Boston – July 9, 2013 – MedAptus® today announced that The Brooklyn Hospital Center is undergoing implementation of the company’s Professional Charge Capture (Pro) solution. Physicians across a number of medical and surgical specialties will use the Pro software to code and submit both outpatient and inpatient encounters.</p>

<p>Founded as the borough’s first voluntary hospital, The Brooklyn Hospital Center (TBHC) has been keeping Brooklyn healthy since 1845. Today it is a 464-bed teaching hospital with nearly 3,000 medical professionals and staff, offering basic and specialized medical care, sophisticated diagnostic and therapeutic services, cutting-edge technology, and specialized surgery to nearly 300,000 patients annually. Located in the heart of Brooklyn’s downtown revitalization district, TBHC is a member of the New York-Presbyterian Healthcare System, and the Brooklyn academic and clinical affiliate of Weill Medical College of Cornell University.</p>

<p>Since the majority of TBHC’s reimbursement is derived from governmental payers, revenue cycle effectiveness is of paramount importance. By deploying the MedAptus Pro solution, which is practice-proven to help provider organizations obtain appropriate payment for services rendered faster and at less cost, TBHC will eliminate manual, paper-based processes that tend to diminish revenue. Physician-users across specialties that include cardiology, hematology-oncology, nephrology, and surgery, amongst others, will enter patient charges at the point-of-care while back-office personnel review encounters in MedAptus’ Coder Workstation prior to electronic billing transmission.</p>

<p>Peter Pappas, MD, FACS, chairman of the Department of Surgery at TBHC, helped lead the search for a charge capture system. He joined TBHC in 2010 from The University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey where he first used the MedAptus system. Given a positive user experience and significant financial return on investment, Dr. Pappas suggested TBHC evaluate MedAptus as part of the vendor search.</p>

<p>“Charge documentation can be time-consuming for physicians – surgeons in particular that perform complicated procedures with several billable components. As a former user of MedAptus, I know firsthand that the company places high-value on physician usability and I expect my peers to easily transition from encounter forms. MedAptus’ Pro offering will help us ensure we are capitalizing on all charge opportunities in a compliant manner while the software’s communication safety net means that coding help is only a message away,” said Dr. Pappas.</p>

<p>“To have a former user champion our software in a new organization is a compliment of the highest order. The entire MedAptus team works so diligently to ensure successful implementations, rapid physician adoption, needed product enhancement and documented financial benefit. We are thrilled to welcome The Brooklyn Hospital Center as the latest MedAptus customer and are focused on delivering a superior service experience,” said Rick Little, vice president of client services at MedAptus.</p>
