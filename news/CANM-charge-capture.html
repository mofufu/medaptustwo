								    Boston – June 7, 2016 – MedAptus® today announced that Cardiology Associates of North Mississippi has implemented the company’s Pro Charge solution to improve physician documentation of professional charges for care delivered at North Mississippi Medical Center.
									</p>
							
								<p>
								  Cardiology Associates of North Mississippi (CANM) can trace its roots back over twenty years to the internists that formed Internal Medicine Associates of Tupelo in 1976. CANM doctors were also responsible for opening north Mississippi’s first Cardiac Catheterization Lab in February 1981, as well as many other accomplishments along the way. Of late, CANM has expanded both geographically and in its breadth of services.  As it stands today, CANM boasts 20 full time cardiology specialists, who together cover the continuum of modern cardiac care.  
								</p>
								
								<p>
								   CANM undertook a review of charge capture software offerings in order to find an easy-to-use, ICD-10 ready solution capable of eliminating paper and manual handoffs from its coding workflow. Some of the core requirements for selecting a technology included a proven installation track record in the cardiology specialty, experience across inpatient, outpatient and ER care settings, intuitive end-user navigation on the iOS platform, and turnkey integration with the groups’ athenahealth athenaCollector billing system. Upon completing a thorough product evaluation, the CANM team concluded MedAptus’ Pro Charge Capture was best suited to meet its needs. 
								</p>
								<p>
								   “Over the course of our evaluation process, MedAptus presented itself as highly customer-oriented, a strong indication that the company would be a responsive partner as we undertook a significant process overhaul. As our due diligence progressed and our team started to get more insight into the solution’s capabilities, we concluded that MedAptus was the right choice to enable our success,” offered Wendy Chisholm, CFO at Cardiology Associates of North Mississippi. 
								</p>
								<p>
								   The MedAptus configuration for CANM places the MedAptus Pro solution square in the middle of disparate vendor systems – medical center admissions data from Allscripts Sunrise with clean bills transmitting outbound to athenaCollector. MedAptus has helped reduce administrative overhead given its ability to automatically append appropriate demographical information and billing record identification requirements to completed inpatient encounters. The net result of this is increased billing timeliness with no further administrative touches. 
								</p>
								<p>
								  “Despite so many automation advances stemming from EMRs and like systems this past decade, the inpatient professional fee coding process is still frequently left to paper, an error prone process requiring multiple touches and lacking adequate reconciliation.  This often leads to revenue loss and back-office inefficiency,” said Corey Richardson, MedAptus chief revenue officer. “We are delighted to expand our cardiology presence with the addition of this tech-savvy group.”
