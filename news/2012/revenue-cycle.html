								    Boston – February 29, 2012 – MedAptus®, the market leader for charge capture technologies, today announced that its flagship Professional Intelligent Charge Capture solution has been expanded to include a sophisticated reporting and performance analytics package. Consistent with continuous process improvement principles, the new module helps customers drive measurable operational improvements and higher financial return in an increasingly challenging healthcare delivery and reimbursement environment.</p>
							
		<p>MedAptus’ comprehensive charge capture and management technologies are used by organizations ranging from single-specialty practices to large academic medical centers. Point-of-care software tools are available to clinical users via Internet browsers, smartphone devices and/or integration with both commercial and proprietary electronic medical record systems. Administrative staff utilize MedAptus in concert with providers to reconcile and review their captured charges in real-time.</p>

<p>The new reporting and analytics suite is available as an integral part of MedAptus’ core Professional offering. The module incorporates a number of standard performance metrics within a comprehensive set of reports focused on revenue cycle performance improvement. Through a simple and intuitive interface, end-users can customize and execute both interactive and scheduled reports that analyze, trend, and benchmark performance using indicators such as physician work output RVUs, charge lag, missing charges, and E&M intensity levels. Additionally, drill-through features in many of the reports provide front-line managers with actionable information to drive improved results.</p>

<p>MedAptus introduced its enhanced reporting package to early customer adopters in the latter half of 2011. University Physician Associates of New Jersey, Inc., (UPA), the faculty practice plan of the New Jersey Medical School and a MedAptus customer since 2003, is planning to use the reports to improve the flow of information back to its physicians. “We have a number of department administrators utilizing the reports and feedback has been very positive. There is a lot of excitement around the increased transparency the new module provides. As one example, the accessibility of additional concrete data around charge lag, both time and cause, has enabled targeted follow-up to providers to try and enhance charge timeliness, an ongoing business objective of ours,” said David Haier, director of business development at UPA.</p>

<p>Rick Little, MedAptus vice president of client services added, “These new reporting and analytical capabilities really advance our ability to help customers drive revenue cycle enhancement. The performance measures are easy to access and readily support trending and benchmarking – two essential ingredients of effective process improvement.”</p>
