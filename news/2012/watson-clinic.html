								    Boston – March 8, 2012 – MedAptus®, the market leader for charge capture technologies, today announced that central Florida’s Watson Clinic LLP has chosen the company’s Professional Intelligent Charge Capture solution for its 294 multi-specialty providers. The technology will be deployed across numerous inpatient and outpatient locations to automate the organization’s professional charge capture and management activities.</p>
							
	<p>Watson Clinic, based in Lakeland, Florida, was originally founded seventy years ago and is now one of the most sizable medical clinics in the southeastern United States. The Clinic employs a large physician-base in over 40 clinical specialties, treating over 920,000 patient visits a year in its 16 locations.</p>

<p>MedAptus’ Professional Intelligent Charge Capture technology is a powerful, flexible offering applicable to practically any setting of care, specialty and provider type. In addition to yielding measurable financial and operational benefits, the application’s mobile platform makes it an ideal solution for clinicians treating patients at multiple, geographically diverse locations. With MedAptus, providers benefit from embedded patient, visit and compliance intelligence at the point-of-care while administrative personnel enjoy enhanced charge review, reconciliation and reporting abilities as well as process transparency.</p>

<p>Historically, Watson Clinic’s professional charge capture processes have been primarily paper-based. To reduce costs and improve revenue cycle performance the Clinic sought technology to streamline and re-engineer its approach to provider coding and billing. Physician and executive leadership at Watson Clinic also found MedAptus to be highly capable of supporting a successful transition to the expansive ICD-10 code set.</p>

<p>“As an organization that prides itself as being state-of-the-art in terms of adopting technology, tools such as charge capture software have been on our IT radar screen for some time now. We made significant effort this past year reviewing available technologies and believe MedAptus to be the best fit for our group given the application’s flexibility for multiple specialties, physician-friendly functionality add-ons and the company’s strong track record meeting the needs of complex medical organizations. We are excited to get our MedAptus deployment underway in order to eliminate paper from our physician charge process and reap the resulting financial and workflow rewards,” said Stephanie Coggins, Director of Patient Financial Services at Watson Clinic LLP.</p>

<p>“Groups with paper processes have always found MedAptus to be an attractive solution to ease the revenue, compliance, and administrative risks that accompany manual and paper processes. Moreover, even though HHS has delayed the transition date, ICD-10 will be coming. Practices such as Watson Clinic are accelerating the push to automate to help ease the ICD-10 code set migration for providers that may have little to no coding experience,” stated Ryan Secan, MD, MedAptus Chief Medical Officer. “We are quite excited about our work with the Watson Clinic team and we look forward to helping them both streamline their operations and improve revenue performance.”</p>
