								    Boston – August 29, 2012 – MedAptus®, the market leader for charge capture technologies, today announced that Cornerstone Health Care has selected the company’s Pro Charge Capture solution to streamline inpatient coding and billing activities.</p>

<p>Cornerstone Health Care, located in central North Carolina, is a physician-owned and managed practice comprised of over 300 physicians, physician assistants and nurse practitioners serving patients in the Piedmont Triad communities. The first users of MedAptus at Cornerstone will be hospitalists who are eager to re-engineer paper-based processes supporting both charge capture and sign-out, well in advance of the ICD-10 changeover.</p>

<p>Hospitalist Director E. Allen Joslyn, M.D., initiated the search for a charge capture vendor in order to eliminate missed charge opportunities and overall workflow inefficiencies. A number of vendor systems were evaluated across criteria that included ease of use, coding and compliance support, and robust back-office reconciliation functionality. Ultimately the review team concluded that MedAptus was best-suited to address the organization’s software needs while delivering a successful implementation.</p>

<p>“We found the MedAptus technology to be strongly aligned with our system criteria. The solution’s physician workflow was intuitive with features clearly designed to expedite inpatient provider coding and communication activities. And as we got to know MedAptus, it became apparent that they would be a partner of ours, ensuring system optimization for achieving physician adoption and a measurable return on investment,” stated Dr. Joslyn.</p>

<p>MedAptus’ Pro solution is used for physician charge capture activities by organizations ranging from single-specialty practices to large academic medical centers. Customers rely on MedAptus to simplify complex processes and provide data integration across disparate systems. In recent years the company has experienced high demand from inpatient medicine groups given a lack of point-of-care tools designed to support the unique scheduling and communication needs of hospitalists.</p>

<p>“Our Pro solution is a nice fit for Cornerstone since the technology is flexible enough to address the variety of coding and practice requirements of a multi-specialty group, yet it has been significantly enhanced for the specific needs of inpatient providers. Rounding list management, reconciliation, sign-out and messaging are features that are beneficial for physicians such as hospitalists, filling in gaps where other systems, both IT and manual, have fallen short,” said Ryan Secan, MD, chief medical officer at MedAptus. “We are pleased to welcome Cornerstone Health Care as our newest customer. Cornerstone recognizes that there is an opportunity to drive both revenue and efficiency and we look forward to collaborating with them to realize these improvements.”</p>

<p>The roll-out of MedAptus is underway at Cornerstone, where hospitalists will utilize Pro for charge capture at High Point Regional Hospital. There are additionally a number of other specialties interested in using MedAptus to enhance their inpatient coding activities from capture to review, reconciliation and reporting.</p>
