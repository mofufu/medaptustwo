								    Boston – December 20, 2012 – MedAptus® today announced that Colorado Springs Health Partners, P.C. (CSHP) will be implementing the company’s Professional Charge Capture (Pro) solution to replace manual coding and billing processes for inpatient professional fee billing. CSHP chose MedAptus after completing a competitive vendor review that included software user interface comparisons, reference calls and customer satisfaction scores.</p>

<p>The mission of Colorado Springs Health Partners, P.C. is to provide a patient-centered, multi-specialty health care delivery system while making a positive and caring contribution to the Colorado Springs community. To that end, the practice has committed to care coordination and integration across the continuum of care provided by just over 100 CSHP physicians working in 20 specialties and 10 clinical locations.</p>

<p>The first users of MedAptus at CSHP will be their hospitalists, a group that currently uses paper for charge capture processes. According to CSHP Chief Medical Officer Dennis Schneider, MD, “While our core reason for choosing MedAptus is to eliminate the inefficiencies associated with paper charge tickets, we also see value in the Pro system’s sign-out and messaging features. Any tools that can help our providers more easily communicate with each other aids with their own practice effectiveness and most importantly, patient care.”</p>

<p>As an organization CSHP is starting to transition into newer reimbursement models that look to quality and patient outcomes rather than purely the number of patients seen. The group believes that the MedAptus tool will have utility as they start to accept bundled payments, and help with the practice’s own quality measures. The adoption of MedAptus will also enable the group to analyze charge data in light of clinical data to make continuous improvement in both realms. This sort of correlation simply has not been possible in the historical paper-based process for charge capture.</p>

<p>“We are very excited to get started with MedAptus. We expect to experience a strong return on our investment based on improved timeliness of charge submission and ultimately receipt of payment. We also believe that the company’s Coder Workstation will greatly enhance our reconciliation processes which are currently more manual and time-consuming for staff,” said Debbie Chandler, CEO of Colorado Springs Health Partners, P.C. “We consider ourselves a very innovative practice on many fronts and feel that this new implementation will be a win-win for us and our patients as it has been for MedAptus’ other inpatient focused customers.”</p>

<p>“As an inpatient medicine provider myself I know how hard it can be to fulfill administrative requirements in a timely manner and the many communication challenges stemming from shift work. The MedAptus Pro application suite was designed to address these pervasive issues head-on and the enhancements we make continuously improve provider efficiency. CSHP is a forward-thinking group and we are eager to work with them around a new electronic workflow for charge capture and management that we are confident their providers will happily embrace,” stated Ryan Secan, MD, chief medical officer of MedAptus.</p>
