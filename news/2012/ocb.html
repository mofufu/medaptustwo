								    Boston – November 29, 2012 – Today MedAptus® announced that physicians at Ophthalmic Consultants of Boston (OCB) have adopted the company’s Professional Charge Capture (Pro) solution. OCB providers utilize MedAptus for coding and billing activities stemming from outpatient care delivery across their office and ambulatory surgical center locations in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>OCB was founded in 1969 with the primary goal of providing patients with eye care, laser and surgical treatment of the highest quality. The practice’s ophthalmologists are Board Certified and hold teaching appointments at Harvard Medical School and/or Tufts University School of Medicine. OCB providers treat over 150,000 patients each year with all categories of eye disorders and visual system diseases. This level of care has earned OCB a national and international reputation for excellence.</p>

<p>OCB sought a robust charge capture solution to automate and improve its professional revenue cycle. Contributing to the practice’s decision to purchase MedAptus is the ease in which the company’s Pro solution can be seamlessly integrated with any electronic medical record (EMR) system. OCB has taken full advantage of this capability by having their clinicians enter charges in MedAptus from the practice’s EMR. After completing a note in the patient’s electronic record, rapid access to the same patient in MedAptus for charge documentation occurs via a single click.</p>

<p>OCB end-users also rely on MedAptus for completion of pay-for-performance measures. The Pro system utilizes real-time alerts to prompt clinicians to document required data elements for quality reporting programs such as PQRS. Only common clinical terms are presented to the user, for quality measures specific to his or her specialty, saving valuable time and ensuring compliance with program guidelines. OCB also takes advantage of the MedAptus custom rules module, enabling the practice to increasingly and proactively flag encounters for secondary review. While MedAptus’ standard rules engine scrubs charge data with over one million compliance rules, the custom rules capability enables customers such as OCB to create their own flags based on unique payer or diagnostic situations.</p>

<p>“We have experienced strong financial benefit as a result of deploying the MedAptus application. Physicians find the tool easy to use, which has driven provider adoption, a critical factor in achieving return on investment. The Pro solution also provides us with insightful revenue cycle data that we leverage for financial and operational impact. We share this information with our providers via a dashboard to keep them informed around compensation target progress which they truly appreciate,” said Trexler M. Topping, MD, President & Medical Director, Ophthalmic Consultants of Boston.</p>

<p>“OCB is an excellent example of how a forward-thinking medical group can leverage technology. They approached our implementation systematically and now receive great benefit from the application of our tools to coding and billing processes,” said MedAptus Vice President of Account Management Jeffrey Pagnini. “We have enjoyed working with OCB and are impressed by their IT know-how and revenue cycle expertise. OCB is a model customer that we believe other single-specialty groups could learn from in terms of rapid implementation and effectiveness with end-users.”</p>
