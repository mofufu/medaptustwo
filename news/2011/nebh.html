								    Boston – February 16, 2011 – MedAptus®, the market leader for charge capture technologies, today announced that New England Baptist Hospital (NEBH) has selected the company’s Professional Intelligent Charge Capture technology for its inpatient medicine providers. The NEBH hospitalist team, comprised of both physicians and nurse practitioners, will access MedAptus’ Inpatient Edition via the web as well as iPhone® and BlackBerry® devices.</p>
							
	</p>NEBH, located in Boston, offers nationally recognized expertise in orthopedic surgery, built on more than a century of experience. The hospital has been named a top orthopedic hospital by U.S. News & World Report and is additionally a teaching affiliate of Tufts University School of Medicine.</p>

</p>MedAptus’ Inpatient Edition was designed specifically to meet the needs of hospital-based providers. A robust yet easy-to-use rounding list feature, integrated messaging and embedded pay-for-performance logic ensure optimal reimbursement and productivity for busy hospitalists that provide care for many patients over long shifts. MedAptus’ companion Reconciliation, Coding & Administration dashboard provides Inpatient Edition customers with admission-based reconciliation views, rounding list management capabilities and exception-based charge management.</p>

</p>NEBH executives reached out to MedAptus to help the hospital improve its approach to professional charge capture and management. Prior to engaging MedAptus, the hospitalist providers utilized paper charge slips to document patient encounters. Completed forms were then sent to the group’s billing vendor. By replacing paper with technology, the entire process will be executed electronically, expediting time-to-payment for the group.</p>

</p>“We selected MedAptus in order to accomplish two key objectives – decreasing charge lag and increasing cash flow. Beyond the technology’s ability to help us achieve those ends, we also recognized other system benefits. As one example, real-time census updates from the MEDITECH hospital system let providers know exactly where their patients are located, a gain for provider efficiency,” said Lauren B. Finnegan, director of physician relations and offices at New England Baptist Hospital.</p>

</p>“The addition of New England Baptist Hospital to the MedAptus customer base means further expansion of our sizable provider presence in the Northeast. We are of course excited to deploy our software at an organization known for groundbreaking orthopedic advancements and expect the clinician-users there to embrace our technology as a tool that drives personal, team and operational efficiencies,” said David Delaney, MD, MedAptus’ chief medical officer.</p>
