								    Boston – November 15, 2011 – MedAptus®, the market leader for charge capture technologies, today announced that Barnabas Health has selected the company’s Professional Intelligent Charge Capture solution to improve physician coding and billing operations across a number of specialties and locations.</p>
							
			<p>Barnabas Health is the largest health care delivery system in New Jersey with over 4,500 physicians providing treatment and services to more than two million patients annually. The Barnabas Health system includes six acute care hospitals, two children’s hospitals, ambulatory care centers, geriatric centers, the state’s largest statewide behavioral health network and comprehensive home care and hospice programs.</p>

<p>MedAptus’ Professional Intelligent Charge Capture is a powerful yet easy-to-use solution proven to mitigate potential professional revenue loss, compliance overhead and lack of billing process transparency. The software is currently deployed to physician-users in groups such as pediatrics, hospital medicine, oncology and critical care across Barnabas Health acute care hospital locations. These providers access MedAptus on their BlackBerry® smartphones, leveraging the power of mobile devices for supporting point-of-care charge capture for busy providers.</p>

<p>Initially Barnabas Health sought MedAptus’ technology to address revenue cycle challenges around inpatient physician billing practices at Saint Barnabas Medical Center. Interest in MedAptus was strengthened by a physician’s firsthand, positive experience with the company’s technology while practicing elsewhere, utilizing the software for professional fee coding. With the inclusion of Newark Beth Israel Medical Center in system roll-out, MedAptus actually became a replacement for a different mobile charge capture system.</p>

<p>“Part of our decision to engage with MedAptus had to do with needing to replace an older charge capture technology. However it’s become clear over these past months of adoption that MedAptus is much more than a replacement system. The technology is very robust, enabling provider-users to complete coding much more efficiently than before, and with a number of embedded tools that ensure charge accuracy, thoroughness and timeliness. This all supports our ability to meet a core objective of revenue cycle enhancement,” said Michael McTigue, corporate vice president of Information Technology at Barnabas Health. “The team at MedAptus delivered a fairly seamless technology transition and this also helped make our initial roll-out quite successful.”</p>

<p>Barnabas Health will be offering MedAptus to additional specialties, providers and locations in the coming months.</p>

<p>“When it comes to operations, large multi-hospital systems such as Barnabas Health have unique and disparate needs that MedAptus is well-suited to address. This includes both software that is flexible enough to easily address different workflows across specialties and our implementation staff resources that are skilled in working with complex entities to bring up software on time and on budget,” said Rick Little, vice president of client services at MedAptus. Little added that, “Barnabas Health is a savvy organization that we have enjoyed working with. We look forward to enlarging our application footprint within the system as well as New Jersey where we already had considerable adoption.”</p>
