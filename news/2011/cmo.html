								    Boston – September 28, 2011 – MedAptus®, the market leader for charge capture technologies, today announced that Ryan A. Secan, MD, MPH, has joined the company in the role of Chief Medical Officer (CMO). Dr. Secan is currently a practicing hospitalist at Emerson Hospital in Concord, Massachusetts. He was previously medical director of hospitalist programs at Lowell General Hospital Medical Group and Anna Jaques Hospital, both also located in Massachusetts.</p>
							
				<p>	In addition to his clinical experience, Dr. Secan brings a strong interest in physician mobile computing and has led the deployment of such tools in the hospital setting. This background will play a significant role in his interaction with MedAptus clinician end-users, many of whom utilize the company’s Professional Intelligent Charge Capture software from their Apple® iPhone® and iPad® devices, and BlackBerry® smartphones.</p>

<p>“As a practicing physician with executive experience, Ryan’s real-world insight will help us engage even more closely and effectively with our provider user base and their clinical leadership. MedAptus solutions have always been focused on streamlining physician workflow and this focus has become even more important as the industry moves towards ICD-10 and accountable care organization concepts evolve. Ryan’s passion for technology and the role it can play in making doctors’ lives easier will benefit our entire customer base as we continue to enhance and expand our solutions,” stated Larry Hagerty, president of MedAptus.</p>

<p>“I’m very excited to join MedAptus. After years of using health information technology that doesn’t seem to be designed with physicians in mind, it is a pleasure to be a part of an organization that takes physician input seriously,” said Dr. Secan. “In addition to bringing my perspective as a full-time clinician to the company, I also hope to draw on the collective wisdom of our customers to improve our products and the user experience. Specifically, a broad base of feedback will be critical to ensure that our customers have a seamless transition to ICD-10,” he added.</p>

<p>Dr. Secan holds a B.A. from the University of Rochester, and received his medical degree from the University of South Florida College of Medicine. He completed residency training in internal medicine at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center and later went on to obtain a Master of Public Health degree from Harvard University. Dr. Secan is board certified in internal medicine and is a member of the American College of Physicians as well as the Society of Hospital Medicine.</p>
