								<p class="lead">Hospitalist Teams from Health Systems, Community Hospitals and Academic Medical Centers Enjoy Intelligent Patient-Provider Assignment to Reduce Length of Stay and Cost</p>
								
								
						<p>MedAptus today announced that its Assign for Rounding Providers platform has been installed at nearly 20 hospitals in 2016, less than a year after general product availability. Assign is the cornerstone of MedAptus’ emerging care coordination suite, which leverages existing admission and workforce scheduling data to automatically assemble the optimal care team and support collaboration across the care continuum. </p>

<p>Assign for Rounding Providers has been enthusiastically embraced by hospitalist group leaders for its ability to replace manual patient assignment processes with computerized logic that can simultaneously apply multiple assignment protocols in order to distribute patients in a fair, equitable manner. This workload balancing feature is especially critical to not only provider satisfaction, but patient safety as well, given that studies show 40 percent of hospitalists routinely report unsafe patient loads. Problematic workloads are also linked to longer length of stays and increased cost. </p>

<p>Customers that have adopted Assign include a number of hospital systems already using MedAptus for professional charge entry and submission. Beyond enjoying benefits from a fast, accurate patient list each morning that is also distributed in multiple form factors across the hospital, reducing morning calls and pages, these groups also enjoy seamless integration between Assign and Pro Charge.</p>

<p>One such customer that expanded its relationship with MedAptus via the adoption of Assign is Kennedy Health, an integrated, multi-hospital system in southern New Jersey. Care for admitted patients across each of Kennedy’s three acute care hospitals is managed by a team of nearly 30 employed hospitalists.</p> 
<p>Anthony Wehbe, DO, MBA, Kennedy Health Chief Population Health Executive, spearheaded the healthcare organization’s decision to begin using MedAptus Assign.</p>

<p>“We wanted to facilitate and improve communications between all healthcare associates involved in the patient’s hospital visit – from the admissions staff to the post-discharge follow-up,” Wehbe said. “We have been very pleased with the efficiency and results achieved through this program.”</p>

<p>Joseph N. Badolato, DO, Medical Director of the Hospitalist program at Kennedy University Hospital in Stratford, added that, “Beyond driving daily time savings and better efficiency, there are other end-user benefits, including providing doctors with more detailed information about each patient’s needs through this electronic platform.”</p>

<p>Other groups signing on for Assign to re-invent hospitalist-to-patient alignment processes to help drive improvements around patient outcomes and cost management include Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital-Plymouth, University Physician Associates of New Jersey, Summit Health and another ten hospitals within one of the largest, nonprofit healthcare systems in the country.</p>

<p>“The response to Assign from my hospitalist peers has confirmed much of what I have long suspected – that there has to be a better way to create patient-provider relationships in the acute setting, especially these days where hospitalists are key to initiatives seeking to prevent re-admissions. Disregarding factors such as continuity and acuity work against a provider’s ability to obtain and nurture the sometimes nuanced patient information that can be the X factor when it comes to a re-admit,” offered Ryan Secan, MD, MPH, MedAptus Chief Medical Officer.</p>

<p>For hospitalists attending the SHM Leadership Conference in Lake Buena Vista, FL, MedAptus will be in the exhibit area demonstrating its hospitalist-oriented solutions.</p>
