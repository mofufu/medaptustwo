								    Boston – March 24, 2015 – MedAptus®, today announced that Maury Regional Medical Center has contracted for the company’s Professional Charge Capture (Pro) solution for deployment to Family Health Group, the physician business unit within the Maury hospital system. More than 40 providers and a team of administrative personnel will utilize MedAptus’ award-winning software suite to enjoy digitized charge capture and operational management.</p>

<p>Maury Regional Medical Center, located in Columbia, Tennessee, serves as the flagship for a group of facilities including Marshall Medical Center in Lewisburg, Wayne Medical Center in Waynesboro, Lewis Health Center in Hohenwald, and Maury Regional Spring Hill and Spring Hill Health Center. Maury Regional Medical Center, a 275-bed hospital, strives to provide, for every patient every day, an individualized, innovative health care service by combining value and world-class clinical outcomes within a personalized, caring environment, and by improving the health of the community through partnerships and integrated networks.</p>

<p>Maury elected to undertake a review of charge capture technologies based on a desire to re-engineer a historically paper-based inpatient coding workflow. The physician team was concerned about the risk of lost charges resulting from multiple handoffs as well as protracted charge lag stemming from a slow process prone to bottlenecks. The organization evaluated a number of available offerings but ultimately chose to partner with MedAptus primarily due to unparalleled capabilities in EHR interoperability.</p>

<p>Nearly ten years ago MedAptus pioneered seamless charge-to-record integration enabling clinical end-users to work within a patient EHR record and then access that same patient record in MedAptus to complete charge documentation. This approach leverages single sign-on and permits charting and charging tasks to be done in tandem. Maury will be implementing this workflow between MedAptus and its MEDITECH clinical system with a future enhancement to include the receipt of diagnosis data, captured within MedAptus, back into MEDITECH.</p>

<p>Leading the vendor search for Maury was CIO Jim Parcel. According to Parcel, “We started our evaluation process with an understanding of core physician charge capture functionality that we expected in order to streamline a manual process before ICD-10 arrives. MedAptus stood out to us early on for a number of reasons including strong customer references, add-on capabilities in the hospital outpatient and infusion services charge capture realm, and of course integration capabilities that would allow us to leverage our existing clinical system. We believe that initiating charge capture from clinical documentation will drive faster physician adoption and also mitigate any learning curve factors.”</p>

<p>This latest customer win expands the growing MedAptus footprint in the state of Tennessee. Implementation is underway to enable Family Health Group providers to electronically submit inpatient encounters with future interest in applying the Pro solution towards other facilities including nursing homes and rehab centers.</p>

<p>“We have enjoyed getting to know the Maury team during the sales process and laud their vision around system interoperability. MedAptus has been very successful in making disparate systems talk to each other. This skill is of increasing importance to reduce the data silo effect and to allow healthcare organizations to have choice when it comes to the IT systems they believe are best suited to solve business challenges,” said Eugene Schneider, MedAptus president and CEO. “We look forward to helping Maury transition away from paper and to realize quantifiable financial impact.”</p>
