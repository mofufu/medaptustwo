								    Boston – June 2, 2015 – MedAptus® today announced that Kentucky Medical Services Foundation, Inc. (KMSF) has contracted for the company’s Enroll offering, powered by Newport Credentialing Solutions, the nation’s premier provider of cloud-based credentialing workflow software and IT enabled services. By implementing Enroll for its growing provider base, KMSF will stem the potential revenue loss that can occur when a provider is not fully credentialed with a patient’s payer at the time of an encounter.</p>

<p>Based in Lexington, Kentucky, KMSF is a non-profit organization that was founded in 1978 and provides support for the more than 900 physicians and other healthcare providers affiliated with UK HealthCare. The system, which offers care in over 80 specialty areas, also operates acute medical centers such as Chandler Hospital, Good Samaritan Hospital, and Kentucky Children’s Hospital.</p>

<p>KMSF first engaged with MedAptus in 2008 for the company’s Pro Charge solution. Over the years, the MedAptus technology has been deployed to several hundred physicians and extenders to automate pro fee coding and billing processes at the point-of-care, with the benefit of embedded compliance intelligence and messaging tools. Today at KMSF, MedAptus serves as the central hub for operational charge management, reconciling and scrubbing charges entered directly by providers as well as charges passed from systems that include an outpatient EMR and computer-assisted coding from 3M.</p>

<p>In late 2014 MedAptus announced the Enroll offering as a front-end complement to its Charge capabilities. As payer enrollment requirements and policies continue to become more stringent, the risk of revenue loss associated with late and denied applications is a very real threat, particularly to larger organizations like KMSF. Groups that accept provider enrollment as a revenue cycle issue needing to be tightly managed with key performance metrics are better positioned to respond to regulatory changes and the emergence of new plan types as opposed to groups that view enrollment as a human resources function.</p>

<p>“MedAptus has been a valuable partner to KMSF and as someone who has prior experience with Newport Credentialing Solutions and its offerings, which comprise the Enroll solution, I am confident that the combined effort will produce the revenue cycle effect we are seeking,” said Motti Edelstein, chief revenue officer, UK HealthCare. He added that, “While we are delighted that more of our patients have coverage today, the explosion of new plans has increased the administrative overhead of provider enrollment, making the Enroll solution a critical part of how we will manage operational effectiveness.”</p>

<p>“Our relationship with KMSF has evolved tremendously over the past seven years. As their needs have changed and grown more complex with the addition of new technologies, we have responded accordingly. As it became apparent to us that customers such as UK HealthCare and Kentucky Medical Services Foundation are facing more opportunities for revenue loss due to increased payer requirements, we took a look at the earliest phase of the revenue cycle and found one administrative task that could cause much downstream loss – provider enrollment. Adding Newport’s software and service capabilities to our portfolio to address that issue was an easy decision given the company’s reputation and outstanding ROI results. We are happy that we could bring this offering to KMSF and help the organization improve enrollment timeliness and overall financial performance,” said Eugene Schneider, MedAptus president and CEO.</p>
