								    Boston – October 27, 2015 – MedAptus® today announced that Emerson Hospital has selected the company’s Pro Charge Capture technology for its inpatient medicine, pediatrics and behavioral health providers. These clinical end-users utilize the Pro solution while on rounds at both Emerson and Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospitals; the software is accessed via web-enabled workstations and mobile devices.</p>

<p>Founded in 1911, Emerson Hospital is a full-service, regional medical center headquartered in historic Concord, Massachusetts. Emerson provides advanced medical services to more than 300,000 people in 25 towns. The 179-bed hospital and its 300 primary care doctors and specialists, care for everything from arrhythmias to urology.</p>

<p>Emerson’s decision to engage with MedAptus was driven by a desire to replace the hospital’s existing charge capture technology with a more robust application. Since deploying Pro to an initial group of physicians, Emerson has found its clinical end-users are experiencing significant efficiency improvements in a number of areas that include the capture of inpatient consults and the management of individual rounding lists. Emerson implemented the ICD-10 version of Pro and users have been quite positive about the ease with which they can locate needed diagnosis codes even with the expanded code set. The Pro solution has also enabled the entry of outpatient charges when needed; before MedAptus, this scenario proved challenging.</p>

<p>“We are happy with our new MedAptus relationship. Our providers have found that Pro is an easy app to adopt and appreciate the intuitive navigation of the software. They are now capturing services that were difficult to document previously, and with overall greater speed since Pro enables fast access to patient coding history and a powerful ICD-10 clinical keyword search,” said Dr. Gregory Martin, chief medical officer, Emerson Hospital. “And since MedAptus supports multiple browsers, which may seem insignificant on the surface, doctors can complete charge capture from their hardware of choice, which has enhanced their satisfaction.”</p>

<p>Beyond the benefits to Emerson providers, there have also been a variety of business office improvements experienced. As one example, the MedAptus rules engine is configured to flag for duplicate billing encounters on the same day of service before any charges are sent to Emerson’s billing company. This intelligence lessens the amount of charge review that must take place prior to claims creation.</p>

<p>“Adding another local hospital to our customer list is something we find especially exciting. Our team has enjoyed getting to know and solve problems that were outstanding at Emerson Hospital despite having used electronic charge capture prior to the Pro deployment. The results after only a few weeks of live usage have been as we expected – greater overall personal productivity, better access to data and streamlined processes from the point-of-care to the business office. We look forward to growing this relationship over the years to come,” said Eugene Schneider, MedAptus president and CEO.</p>
