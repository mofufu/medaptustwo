								    Boston – July 21, 2015 – MedAptus® today announced that Bon Secours Richmond Health System has implemented the company’s Pro Charge Capture technology for its adult hospitalist and pediatric hospitalist intensivist providers that deliver care at St. Mary’s Hospital. More than 50 clinical-end users are live on the MedAptus Pro solution which is integrated with the hospital’s Epic ConnectCare system and athenaCollector to ease the process of capturing and billing inpatient charges.</p>

<p>Having used paper encounter forms for hospitalist charge capture for a number of years, St. Mary’s decided to undergo a search for software tools to enable electronic coding of encounters in the acute care setting. The goal was to find a technology that would drive provider efficiencies while on rounds, position the team for an easy transition to ICD-10, and support reconciliation to ensure all billable opportunities were being captured. After a vendor evaluation process was conducted, the hospitalist team at Bon Secours decided on MedAptus’ Pro solution, mobile and web-enabled, given its track record with hospitalists in complex enterprises and its proven integration with other HIT systems in place at St. Mary’s Hospital.</p>

<p>“Our providers have recently gone live with MedAptus’ technology and are excited to eliminate more manual processes from their daily workflow. MedAptus Pro is easy to use, utilizing tools which enable team members to more easily communicate with one another, whether they need to exchange salient patient information securely or pose a question to our coding staff about proper charge documentation,” said Jill Camden, practice administrator, adult hospitalist department, St. Mary’s Hospital. “We appreciate the enthusiasm MedAptus brought to our implementation, making sure St. Mary’s was off to a strong start with the system.”</p>

<p>Hospitalist and intensivist end-users at St. Mary’s benefit from the real-time integration of data from its Epic ADT system that enables the creation and display of a very accurate rounding list for both busy clinicians on the floor and those in the business office responsible for daily reconciliation of all expected charges. This workflow was created at another MedAptus customer site and can be easily replicated at other hospitals seeking inpatient charge capture automation leveraging existing data that can inform a physician’s rounding census.</p>

<p>“It is a pleasure to help re-engineer charge capture workflows for hospitalist groups ready to streamline and improve operations particularly as the countdown to ICD-10 carries on. With the group at St. Mary’s now live on Pro and planning their transition to our ICD-10 version shortly, the user community there will greatly benefit from our unique history bridge which utilizes patient diagnosis data to derive a search in ICD-10 based on clinical intent, expediting encounter documentation despite an expanded code set,” said Ryan Secan, MPH, MD, MedAptus chief medical officer.</p>

<p>By choosing MedAptus, Bon Secours Richmond Health System was able to benefit from the company’s partnership with athenahealth under its More Disruption Please program. This relationship lets customers utilize a standard, proven athenahealth demographic and charge interface with powerful API functionality that all greatly reduces burden on business office resources in order to expedite charge throughput.</p>

<p>Bon Secours Richmond is part of Bon Secours Health System, Inc., a $3.4 billion not-for-profit Catholic health system headquartered in Marriottsville, Maryland. In 1966, Bon Secours opened St. Mary’s Hospital in Richmond. Today, the health system is one of the area’s largest employers, nationally recognized by AARP and Working Mother magazine. In addition to its five hospitals, Bon Secours Richmond includes a college of nursing, a school of medical imaging and includes nearly 420 providers as part of the Bon Secours Medical Group.</p>
