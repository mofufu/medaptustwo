								    Boston – June 10, 2014 – MedAptus® today announced First Coast Cardiovascular Institute (FCCI) is live on the company’s Professional Charge Capture (Pro) application and is already experiencing significantly reduced charge lag just weeks after installation.</p>

<p>First Coast Cardiovascular Institute offers unparalleled medical expertise in the fields of cardiovascular medicine, neurology, and sleep disorders. FCCI’s physicians are pioneers well-known in their fields locally in the Jacksonville, Florida area, as well as internationally.</p>

<p>MedAptus was first contacted by FCCI in late 2013 as the practice sought a replacement charge capture solution more applicable to its range of specialties. After a thorough evaluation process, FCCI determined MedAptus was the best fit for the group based on functionality and a strong track record of success in the multi-specialty environment. FCCI was eager to have the Pro software deployed in less than a month, which the MedAptus team easily accommodated.</p>

<p>According to Resource Manager Elias Demetree who led the vendor review process for FCCI, “We undertook the software review process carefully and in the end found MedAptus to offer a superior application. The installation went smoothly and many of our providers immediately reported the Pro product was more user-friendly than other apps they had previously used. MedAptus is a good choice for our practice and a helpful tool for our physicians. We look forward to expanding our relationship with the company as our group continues to grow over time.”</p>

<p>Prior to the implementation of MedAptus, FCCI often experienced upwards of two weeks in lag time between an inpatient charge encounter and the billing process. Since going live, this lag has been brought down to under three days, with physicians routinely submitting charges electronically on the same day of service. As the practice looks to add more providers in the future, there will not be a need to hire additional coding support staff given the increased business-office productivity MedAptus has delivered.</p>

<p>“Widespread customer feedback continues to support the fact that our Pro solution drives strong financial returns, both top line and bottom line. As FCCI found, re-engineering charge capture and charge management with the Pro software markedly brings down charge lag and increases end-user efficiency from the point-of-care to the back-office,” said Patrick Campbell, Pro product manager at MedAptus. “The FCCI team has been great to work with and we are happy to support their mission as a practice committed to helping patients with complex co-morbidities.”</p>
