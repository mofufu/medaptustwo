								    Boston – March 20, 2014 – MedAptus® today announced that Methodist Healthcare has implemented the company’s Professional Charge Capture (Pro) solution to re-engineer paper-based processes for inpatient coding and billing. Methodist chose the MedAptus software based on ease-of-use, support for team care and robust real-time reconciliation capabilities.</p>

<p>Methodist Healthcare is an integrated, not-for-profit healthcare delivery system based in Memphis, Tennessee. The seven-hospital system includes home health services, outpatient surgery centers, minor medical centers, diagnostic centers, sleep centers and a hospice residence. With nearly 2,000 affiliated physicians, Methodist is rated as the number one hospital in the Memphis region by U.S. News and World Report, and has received accolades in twelve specialties including neurology and heart surgery.</p>

<p>According to Bill Breen, senior vice president for physician alignment at Methodist Healthcare, “We selected the MedAptus technology because of its proven ability to deliver measurable efficiency improvements. By enabling our providers to complete charge capture with higher accuracy and better timeliness, we are reducing our charge lag, which increases cash flow. We also are finding productivity gains with our back-office personnel since transitioning to an exception-based workflow, as opposed to the multitude of paper hand-offs and manual reconciliation processes they contended with previously.”</p>

<p>The first users of MedAptus at Methodist are cardiologists rounding at more than five owned and area hospitals; these initial technology adopters access Pro via the web as well as iOS devices. A single Cerner registration interface provides patient census data from the Methodist hospitals in order to streamline the patient intake process, including verification of insurance and patient demographical information. Hospitalists are the next group to go live on the MedAptus software and will utilize Pro in the same manner as cardiologists.</p>

<p>“Our physicians have readily adopted the MedAptus technology due to its intuitive design and capabilities that reduce administrative burden on providers. And as we look down the line, seamless integration between the Pro system and our electronic health record via single sign-on and diagnosis passing will drive further clinician efficiency, permitting more time to deliver care,” said Dr. Alastair R. MacGregor, chief healthcare information officer at Methodist Healthcare.</p>

<p>“The demands on providers’ time increase every single year – more patients, more illness, more regulations. These realities inform our product development and keep our team focused on producing software that physicians will actually use and derive measurable benefit from. Methodist Healthcare is a world-class healthcare system that we are thrilled to service,” said Gene Schneider, MedAptus president and CEO.</p>
