								    Boston – September 24, 2014 – MedAptus® today announced that Kennedy University Hospitalists recently completed implementation of the company’s Professional (Pro) Charge Capture solution.</p>

<p>The Kennedy Health System is a health services delivery system serving the communities of southern New Jersey. The team of Kennedy hospitalists work throughout Kennedy’s three acute care facilities – Cherry Hill, Stratford, and Washington Township – to seamlessly coordinate hospitalized patient care, from admission to discharge.</p>

<p>Kennedy University Hospitalists initially undertook a competitive charge capture vendor review to evaluate mobile offerings capable of eliminating paper from the group’s coding and billing process. The organization decided on MedAptus based on Pro system functionality, currently in its 14th release, and strong customer orientation. After a short roll-out period, Kennedy hospitalists were live on MedAptus for both iOS devices and web-enabled workstations. The physicians receive patient census data from the Kennedy network’s Siemens ADT system; completed, clean charges are subsequently sent to the group’s billing software overnight.</p>

<p>“ICD-10 was a large driver for our charge capture search – like many other groups, we had come to rely on paper to document billable events but knew that practice would not be feasible once the code set transition was upon us. The first solution we tried lacked integration with our hospital system which meant administrative burden on our busy providers. With MedAptus Pro, this is all automated. Even though we have only been live two months, we already recognize measurable improvement in our productivity and billing,” said Anthony Wehbe, DO, Medical Director for Kennedy University Hospitalists. Dr. Wehbe added that the MedAptus system’s messaging feature helps expedite the patient assignment process, another task for hospitalists that is typically time consuming.</p>

<p>“As a practicing hospitalist, I know how busy a day on service can get and anything that adds more time to non-patient care events is frustrating. We are glad to help solve some of the efficiency challenges the Kennedy team was facing, and in a timeframe ahead of ICD-10 so that they can benefit from our unique clinical term conversion tool to help derive appropriate ICD-10 codes from a patient’s history in ICD-9,” stated Ryan Secan, MD, MedAptus Chief Medical Officer.</p>

<p>As Kennedy University Hospitalists looks to the future with MedAptus, next steps include operationalizing a set of reports from the Pro Reporting and Analytics module. The group has high interest in comparing service frequency, E&M distribution and wRVUs internally, and against groups of similar size, an offering available through MedAptus’ professional services area.</p>
