								   Boston – February 4, 2014 – MedAptus® today announced that its Professional Charge Capture (Pro) solution has been named the Category Leader in the Mobile Data Systems segment in the “2013 Best in KLAS: Software & Services” report, marking the fourth consecutive year that MedAptus has received the distinction. The company’s top-ranking score of 90.8 is based on customer feedback across measures that evaluate vendor performance in areas including product quality, implementation and support.</p>

<p>MedAptus’ suite of charge capture and operational charge management solutions cover professional, technical, and infusion services coding and billing processes. The company’s customers range in size from single-specialty group practices to large provider entities such as academic medical centers and IDNs. These organizations consistently experience improved revenue, accelerated cash, better productivity and enhanced compliance as a result of deploying MedAptus. One recent customer quote posted in the MedAptus KLAS profile illustrates the financial value that the Pro solution delivers: “MedAptus does a great job of meeting and exceeding customer expectations. When we wanted to expand the use of Pro Charge Capture in our hospital, they guided us through the process. We now have over 140 physicians submitting charges as they do their rounds. As a result, our A/R days dropped and we now have a way to track lost charges. There is no doubt that Pro Charge Capture has paid for itself many times over.”1</p>

<p>“We are pleased to yet again top the KLAS Mobile Data Systems category as we believe that this honor reflects the MedAptus passion for customer service. Our team’s ability to maintain this position year after year speaks to performance consistency and focus in a medical practice environment where change is the only constant,” said Gene Schneider, MedAptus president and CEO. “Clearly 2014 is going to be a challenging year for our customers but we are prepared to help them successfully adapt to new coding workflows and rules brought on by ICD-10. We believe that the effects of ICD-10-CM will be largely revenue neutral for the MedAptus base given our early readiness paired with customer eagerness to deploy our software update well ahead of the October transition date.”</p>
