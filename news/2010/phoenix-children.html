								    Boston – March 31, 2010 – MedAptus®, the market leader for charge capture technologies, today announced that its Intelligent Charge Capture suite of solutions will be deployed at Phoenix Children’s Hospital. MedAptus’ Enterprise Edition encapsulates professional, facility and infusion services charge capture software tools. Approximately 170 physicians will utilize the system for inpatient and outpatient charge capture. Enterprise Edition will also be deployed to the hospital’s outpatient clinics for full transformation of historically time-consuming technical coding and billing processes.</p>
							
								<p>
								  Enterprise Edition is MedAptus’ most comprehensive technology offering, bringing together robust and complementary functionality to create the most sophisticated charge capture automation available today. Capable of supporting every type of provider, in any specialty and care setting, Enterprise Edition drives impressive cash increases and user efficiencies. These benefits are achieved through streamlining both front- and back-office operations and in many cases, extending the value of an EMR investment across an organization’s financial realm.
								</p>
								
								<p>
								   Phoenix Children’s Hospital, Arizona’s only licensed children’s hospital and one of the ten largest freestanding pediatric hospitals in the country, provides care across more than 40 specialties. The hospital is currently undergoing significant growth to serve an even larger population of children and their families. The MedAptus suite will help support this expansion through standardizing administrative processes in order to yield measurable outcomes. 
								</p>
								<p>
								  Phoenix Children’s first sought electronic charge capture to re-engineer its approach to the professional revenue cycle – namely, to help physicians code encounters more accurately and to reduce the time it takes for payment. The scope of the hospital’s interest increased upon learning about MedAptus’ innovative cross-reconciliation functionality, a hallmark of Enterprise Edition. This unique engine ensures both compliance and revenue integrity across the technical and professional components of a singular outpatient visit charge, including even complex visits such as those for chemotherapy.
								</p>
								<p>
								   “In a challenging economy, children’s hospitals find themselves contending with lower reimbursement from payers and higher patient deductibles. Between those realities, and increasing regulation such as recovery audit contracting, it is essential for provider organizations to fine tune their approaches to revenue cycle management and coding compliance. We found MedAptus to be an attractive solution because the tools they offer address many of the issues we face and need to be proactive about. In addition, we expect that our clinicians will enjoy using the MedAptus system for its resulting productivity gains and easier access to vital data points such as patient history,” stated Derrick E. Parker, senior vice president, practice operations, Phoenix Children’s Hospital Medical Group. 
								</p>
								<p>
								  “Welcoming Phoenix Children’s Hospital as the newest MedAptus client is especially exciting because in addition to being our first freestanding children’s hospital customer, we will be playing an important role in what is essentially a complete business process transformation,” said Rick Little, MedAptus’ vice president of client services. “We anticipate a successful roll-out that will benefit the hospital’s talented providers across many levels as well as help the organization meet clearly defined operational and financial objectives.”
