								    Boston – February 24, 2010 – MedAptus®, the market leader for charge capture technologies, today announced that Needham-based Beth Israel Deaconess HealthCare (BIDHC) has selected the company’s Professional Intelligent Charge Capture technology for its hospitalist group. BIDHC, a network of primary care physicians, will roll-out the web-based version of MedAptus’ Inpatient Edition for the timely and compliant capture of inpatient charges originating at three area hospitals.</p>
							
						<p>	Inpatient Edition was designed to effectively address unique revenue capture and practice challenges commonly experienced by hospital-based providers such as hospitalists, intensivists, anesthesiologists and other inpatient consultative specialties. The combination of core ninth-generation functionality from MedAptus’ powerful Professional Intelligent Charge Capture with specific features that simplify patient management, service hand-off and communication, and the documentation of complex coding scenarios is increasingly attractive to busy inpatient providers.</p>

<p>Roberta Parks, MD, Physician Director of Network Development for the Beth Israel Deaconess HealthCare Hospital Medicine Program, and a practicing hospitalist, understands the technologic needs of hospital medicine today. According to Dr. Parks, “Having dedicated hospital medicine resources to provide care to inpatients is a model that makes a lot of sense for a rapidly growing number of physician practices. But the mobile nature of what we do, and our need for accurate data as well as the tools to share new data in a timely manner truly do necessitate a comprehensive solution.”</p>

<p>BIDHC, an organization comprised of nearly 170 physicians, is quite familiar with charge capture functionality. The group purchased a mobile solution some years ago, but with little integrated coding intelligence and no interfaces for easily obtaining patient census data, the product was not able to meet end-user needs. The search for a new charge capture solution, which led BIDHC to MedAptus, was undertaken as the result of an internal study which revealed a return-on-investment opportunity based on improvements in overall coding compliance.</p>

<p>The implementation of Inpatient Edition is currently underway for BIDHC providers. Hospitalist users will have access to the system while rounding on patients at Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital-Needham, Milton Hospital and Good Samaritan Hospital. Patient admission information will be provided to MedAptus via inbound interfaces from each hospital’s MEDITECH system; completed, approved charges will be sent from MedAptus’ RCA Engine to BIDHC’s Ingenix CareTracker system for billing.</p>

<p>“As a practicing intensivist, I am well-acquainted with the intricacies of charge capture inherent to hospital-based medicine. Our Inpatient Edition was created as not only a solution to move providers beyond paper note cards for charge capture, but to also directly address other challenges faced by inpatient focused physicians. This is why our application ensures robust yet flexible team census management, facilitates safe handoffs and enables communication between peers that typically lack face-to-face time,” said David Delaney, MD, Chief Medical Officer at MedAptus. “We are delighted to welcome BIDHC as our newest customer and firmly believe that, like our other hospitalist sites, they will experience both fast adoption and measurable results.”</p>
