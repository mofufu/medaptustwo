								    Boston — June 9, 2010 — MedAptus®, the market leader for charge capture technologies, today announced that Steward Health Care, also based in Boston, has implemented the company’s Intelligent Charge Capture suite for revenue and compliance enhancement initiatives. The organization selected MedAptus’ Practice Plus Edition on BlackBerry smartphone devices and web-enabled workstations for the capture of physician inpatient charges. In addition, Steward is rolling-out the MedAptus Facility Edition for the capture of outpatient clinic charges, starting in the area of cardiology.</p>
							
						<p>MedAptus’ Intelligent Charge Capture technologies support accurate and streamlined coding at the point-of-care. Each application seamlessly integrates with a customer’s existing systems – including scheduling, billing, electronic records, hospital admission and charge data master – and is practice-proven to scale across complex enterprises, process high-volume charges, and adapt to the needs of both clinical specialties and individual users. MedAptus tools yield significant financial improvement and workflow efficiencies, yet are fast to implement and easy to use.
</p>
<p>Steward Health Care, the largest community-based health care system in New England, is comprised of six hospitals and over 13,000 employees that serve more than 600,000 patients annually. The organization turned to MedAptus upon identifying the area of physician charge capture – specifically, low adoption of existing processes – in need of re-engineering via technology.
</p>
<p>Upon recognizing that Practice Plus Edition met Steward’s requirements for a new professional application, Facility Edition was additionally selected to better manage outpatient clinic charge components. When deployed as complements, these tools reduce administrative redundancies, improve overall compliance and increase cash collected. Steward is now the third prestigious, Boston-area provider organization to implement both offerings.
</p>
<p>“When it comes to healthcare information technologies, Steward strives to utilize the best available tools to enhance our clinical care and operating efficiency. Our team recognizes the importance of accurate and timely charge capture operations and we believe that a dedicated, robust solution is integral to achieving those ends. Initial users are now live on the MedAptus system and we expect to experience overall high user adoption leading to ultimately, improved revenue cycle performance,” said Todd Rothenhaus, M.D., senior vice president and chief information officer for Steward Health Care.
</p>
<p>“Steward Health Care enjoys the reputation as an extremely forward thinking organization technologically. As such, we are very excited about this collaboration,” stated Rick Little, vice president of client services, MedAptus. “We anticipate that, like our many other large customer sites, Steward will reap the widespread rewards of charge capture automation and workflow re-design: financial benefit, streamlined workflow and provider efficiency.”</p>
