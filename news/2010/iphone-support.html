								    Boston – August 4, 2010 – MedAptus®, the market leader in charge capture technologies, today announced availability of its version 10.0 Intelligent Charge Capture solution suite. This tenth functional release has support for the company’s physician professional offering on Apple® iPhone®, iPad™ and iPod touch® devices. Other key enhancements aimed at easing complicated physician and administrative workflows are also included.</p>
							
						<p>MedAptus provides comprehensive charge capture and management tools that simplify and streamline coding and billing processes. Faster, more accurate professional coding drives strong financial benefit, improves compliance adherence and yields overall productivity gains. The MedAptus technology is applicable to any setting of care. Customers range from large academic practice plans to renowned cancer centers, mid-sized provider groups and inpatient medicine specialists.</p>

<p>MedAptus’ ability to support its Professional Intelligent Charge Capture solution on the Apple platform expands an already broad array of deployable hardware choices. This gives customers additional flexibility when seeking to leverage existing investments and satisfy end-user preferences.</p>

<p>Initial physician-users of MedAptus version 10.0 are now live and enjoying the look and feel of the iPhone application. The software is currently available for free download in the Apple App Store and requires system licensing and implementation services from MedAptus prior to usage.</p>

<p>“Bringing our charge capture technology to the iPhone’s world-class smartphone platform has been an exciting development endeavor for MedAptus and its engineering team. Our application suits the iPhone form factor nicely, preserving both robustness and ease-of-use,” said James Scott, vice president of engineering at MedAptus. “Numerous other enhancements in version 10.0 are equally as important and certain to further streamline user and administrative workflows for a wide variety of inpatient and outpatient scenarios.”</p>

<p>A core functionality update in version 10.0 is around inpatient charge capture and management. Interest in MedAptus technology from hospitalist groups and inpatient-focused providers has steadily grown over the last two years. How to efficiently ensure that all inpatient encounters requiring a professional charge have one is typically challenging for these groups. The enhanced, calendar-based view of inpatient charge activity in version 10.0 helps providers quickly identify and enter missing charges across a patient’s admission. Administrative users of MedAptus’ RCA Engine, the back-office dashboard companion, also benefit from this view of activity as it simplifies reconciling charges across all providers. The net result is revenue wholeness in the area where many groups experience significant loss.</p>

<p>Version 10.0 also includes an enhancement to the MedAptus P4P reporting component. Providers and administrators can now easily track the percentage of cases on which PQRI data was collected, making the process of qualifying for the PQRI incentive payment much more manageable.</p>

<p>Other updates in version 10.0 designed for increased physician usability include a more nuanced diagnosis search tool as well as greater control over organizing coding service sets and quick-picks. Improvements applicable to administrative and operational users of MedAptus include an enhanced custom rules feature. This expanded logic further automates compliance with localized payer policies.</p>
